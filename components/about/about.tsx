                <h2>What is SimplePinyin?</h2>
                <p>Simple Pinyin is an interactive Pinyin chart I made to practice identifying tones in Mandarin. 
                    I created it because all of the free Pinyin charts I found online didnâ€™t offer a quiz feature and those that did were locked behind a paywall. 
                    Simple Pinyin is provided free without ads.

                <h2>Are you trying to sell me a course?</h2>
                <p>No. I made this primarily for me to use as a tool to learn Pinyin. I'm not a native speaker and don't know enough to teach anyone anything about Mandarin.</p>
