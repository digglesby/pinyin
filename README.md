# Pinyin Learning App

This is a Next.js app designed to help users learn Mandarin Chinese through an interactive Pinyin learning chart.

## About Pinyin Learning Charts

Pinyin is a phonetic system for transcribing the Mandarin pronunciations of Chinese characters into the Latin alphabet. A Pinyin chart includes all the possible sounds in Mandarin Chinese.

The chart is divided into initials (consonants) and finals (vowels or vowel groups). The tones, which can change the meaning of a word, are indicated by marks above the vowels. Mandarin Chinese has four tones:

1. First tone: a high, level tone (represented with a flat line, e.g., ā)
2. Second tone: a rising tone (represented with an upward sloping line, e.g., á)
3. Third tone: a dipping tone (represented with a v-shaped line, e.g., ǎ)
4. Fourth tone: a falling tone (represented with a downward sloping line, e.g., à)

This application provides an interactive way to learn these sounds and tones, providing a solid foundation for your Mandarin Chinese learning journey.
